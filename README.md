# Movie-Recommendation-System
This project focuses on developing a movie recommendation system using various collaborative and content-based filtering techniques to predict movie ratings for both existing and new users. The system was designed to enhance the movie-watching experience by accurately predicting user preferences based on past behavior and demographic information. The project involved splitting survey data into training and test sets to evaluate the performance of different models, with the goal of identifying the most effective approach for recommending movies.

In the first part of the project, predictions were made for movies that hadnâ€™t been watched by any group members, where the User-User Non-normalized Euclidean Distance model emerged as the best performer based on RMSE. In subsequent parts, different models were tested for predicting ratings of specific new movies and new customers, with the Item-Item Non-normalized Cosine and User-User mean-centered Cosine models showing the highest accuracy, respectively. The final part incorporated new customer information, applying the User-User Non-normalized Cosine model to make predictions.

The project also addressed the challenges of data scarcity and scalability, which can limit the accuracy of recommendation models. It suggested potential improvements using techniques like Single Value Decomposition (SVD) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to enhance model performance. The project highlights the importance of recommendation systems in improving user experience and revenue generation, while also acknowledging the need for continuous improvement to handle the complexities of real-world data.
