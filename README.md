# Movie-Recommendation-System
This code implements a comprehensive movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques, divided into four distinct parts. Each part explores different methodologies and evaluation schemes to predict user ratings for movies. The code utilizes user-based and item-based collaborative filtering approaches with various similarity measures, including cosine similarity and Euclidean distance, applied with different normalization techniques like mean-centering and Z-score normalization. It creates evaluation schemes with different split ratios and parameters to train and test the models, ensuring a robust analysis of model performance. The results are compared using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), with visualizations provided to highlight the performance of each model.

Throughout the code, the models are evaluated using different datasets, and the best-performing models are identified based on RMSE. The code also includes various plots to visualize the distribution of user ratings and the comparative performance of different models. The final outputs include prediction results and RMSE scores saved as CSV files, providing a detailed overview of the recommendation system's effectiveness across different scenarios. This approach allows for a thorough examination of collaborative filtering techniques in building a recommendation system, with a focus on varying data handling and model evaluation strategies.
